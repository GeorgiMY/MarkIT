Requirements:
1. You can't have chrome opened
2. You have to be logged in your twitch with chrome
3. Supply the vod id when prompted at the console: (example: 2351186815)
https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/georgi_my/content/video-producer/highlighter/2351186815

Use case:
If you are like me, you stream something and then you make a video out of the stream.
The vod disapears after 7 days so you have that time to download the vod and write down the markers somewhere
If you've had a long stream, that means there were maybe more than 45 markers that you have to go ahead and write down.
This tool takes this responsibility away from you.

Known issues:
1. If the marker is placed as a number, the program will only get the first marker out of all the markers

The format that the markers will be displayed in your console:
1. 17:48
2. 29:34
3. 34:42
4. 44:11
5. 51:08
6. 55:04
7. 1:00:48
8. 1:07:00
9. 1:15:22
10. 1:24:07
11. 1:27:29
12. 1:30:58
13. 1:46:53
